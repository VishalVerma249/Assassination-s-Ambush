#  🥷Assassination's Ambush

This is my **first Python project** – a simple ninja survival game built using **Pygame**.  
I made this project to learn Python and game development basics.

##  About the Game
- You play as a **Ninja warrior** 
- Enemies spawn randomly and move around 
- Throw **Shurikens** to defeat enemies 
- A **score counter** tracks how many enemies you hit  
- The game ends when an enemy collides with the player  
- You can **restart** the game without closing it

##  Controls
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ⬅️ / ➡️ | Move Left / Right |
| ⬆️ / ⬇️ | Move Up / Down |
| Spacebar | Throw Shuriken |
| Enter | Restart after Game Over |
| ESC / Quit | Exit the Game |

##  How to Run
1. Install Python (>= 3.8 recommended)  
2. Install pygame:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Clone this repository and go inside the folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/assassinations-ambush.git
   cd assassinations-ambush
   ```
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

##  Required Assets
Keep these files in the same folder as `main.py`:
- `icon.png` → Game Icon  
- `backgroundimage.png` → Background  
- `ninja.png` → Player Character  
- `enemy ninja.png` → Enemy Character  
- `suriken.png` → Shuriken  
- `backgrogund_music.wav` → Background Music  
- `Thrown Shuriken.wav` → Shuriken Sound  
- `impact.wav` → Collision/Game Over Sound

##  What I Learned
- Basics of **Pygame**
- Handling **images, sounds, and events**
- Writing a **game loop**
- Collision detection
- Showing score and game over screen

---

##  Future Ideas
Since this is my first Python project, I plan to add:
- More levels with higher difficulty
- Different types of enemies
- Power-ups (extra life, faster shuriken, etc.)
- High score system
